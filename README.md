### Quick about me:
Hello I'm Alexander keckley,
and this is my portfolio, which as of writing (3/22/20) i'm still filling out with my projects.
there are very few to go off of at the moment, but i'm still working and expanding on my work.

### Also
I do have multiple other skills and talents that i balance, these include:
 * Editing
 * Live Video & Audio 
 * Audio-work
 * eventually music
Many of these are active hobbies of mine.
